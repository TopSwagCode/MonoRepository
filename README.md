# MonoRepository
Mono Repository. Idea of this project:

* Be the master of all my hooby projects / deployed projects etc.
* Remove all my other old repositories and implement functionality here.
* One repository to rule them all.
* All demo's to be CI/CD through this repository and easy to update / edit in furture.
* One big awesome repository with good documentation all the way through.
* Use sub readme files for projects. Easy to understand how to run on peoples own machines.
* Delete leftover projects / "none supported".
* Find out what license to use. If any. Not everything needs to be open source.
* Clear structure for find things.
* Have as much as possible hosted and running at all times.

# Todos:

* Some basic shared nugetpackage CI/CD
* An awesome WeatherClient with support for all the fancy stuff and good error handling and error messages.
* Some basic rate-limiting. Should help keeping my cheap ass servers up and running :P
* Move all projects in here. One at the time.
* Don't simply delete old repositories. Make link to where the stuff has moved.
